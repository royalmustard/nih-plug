# NOTE: wgpu support has been removed from the iced-baseview fork out because
#       this old iced version uses a wgpu version that doesn't pin the web-sys
#       version it uses, and web-sys broke semver
# # Use wgpu rendering, which translates to Vulkan, Metal, or Direct3D12 depending
# # on the platform.
# # NOTE: The OpenGL support in baseview is not used, this is just a workaround
# #       for a rust analyzer bug. See the comment in lib.rs.

# compatibility at the cost of some iced features not being available.
